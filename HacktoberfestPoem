In October's crisp and golden glow,
Hacktoberfest comes, a time to grow.
A global celebration, open to all,
Where coders unite, both big and small.

From open source projects, far and wide,
We gather together, side by side.
To contribute code, and learn with glee,
A community of makers, you and me.

With pull requests flying, and branches merging,
We're shaping the future, code by code converging.
From fixing bugs, to adding new features,
We're making a difference, together, as one.

So let's raise a glass to Hacktoberfest,
A month of collaboration, at its very best.
Where coders unite, from all around,
To make the tech world, a better place to be found.

Cheers to Hacktoberfest!
